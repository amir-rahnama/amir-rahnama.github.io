## 💼 Work Experience

### 🎙️ Senior Machine Learning Engineer
**All Ears AB** | Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪  
*October 2025 – Present*

I am involved in several ML projects, including optimizing automatic speech recognition (ASR) models; developing multimodal text, audio, and video embedding models; and detecting real-time events. Ranking and recommendation systems that prioritize high-signal brand mentions based on user preferences. As an individual contributor, developed a survival-analysis model to predict time-to-churn and customer retention.

**Tech stack:** Parakeet, VLM2Vec-V2, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers  
**Supervisor:** Fredrik Olsson
