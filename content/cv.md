## Work Experience

### Senior Machine Learning Engineer
**All Ears AB** | Stockholm, Sweden  
*October 2025 – Present*

I am involved in several ML projects, including optimizing automatic speech recognition (ASR) models; developing multimodal text, audio, and video embedding models; and detecting real-time events. Ranking and recommendation systems that prioritize high-signal brand mentions based on user preferences. As an individual contributor, developed a survival-analysis model to predict time-to-churn and customer retention.

**Tech stack:** Parakeet, VLM2Vec-V2, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers  
**Supervisor:** Fredrik Olsson

### Senior Machine Learning Engineer
**Capgemini** | Stockholm, Sweden  
*October 2024 – August 2025*

I was a member of the Generative AI and Analytics (GAIA) Team, where I developed graph-based machine learning, AI, and RAG solutions to detect fraudulent organizations and anomalous supplier payments.

**Tech stack:** Neo4j, PyTorch, Llama, LangChain, Docker, DeepSeek-V3, and Dagster  
**Supervisor:** Tobias Fasth

### Machine Learning
**KTH Royal Institute of Technology** | Stockholm, Sweden  
*January 2019 – September 2024*

I developed machine learning models to automatically predict truck-part maintenance needs (with Scania), built models for personalized medication recommendations based on patient history (with AstraZeneca), and evaluated large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.

**Tech stack:** PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Python  
**Supervisor:** Henrik Boström

### Machine Learning Research Intern
**Spotify** | Stockholm, Sweden  
*May 2020 – September 2020*

I developed ranking and relevance algorithms for a TensorFlow-based search and recommendation model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), enabling accurate prediction of relevant songs and podcasts while making the model explainable.

**Tech stack:** TensorFlow, Google BigTable, Python  
**Supervisors:** Mounia Lalmas, Judith Bütepage
